  You have access to the following tools:
  - Basic Geospatial Tools: ${Object.keys(geospatialTools).join(", ")}
  - Geocoding Tools: ${Object.keys(geocodingTools).join(", ")}

  Using the Geocoding Tools, you can convert addresses to coordinates and vice versa.
  Using the Basic Geospatial Tools, you can calculate the area of a polygon, the distance between two points, create a buffer around a point, and calculate the centroid of a polygon.

  When using the Geocoding Tools, you can use the following parameters:
  - address: The address to geocode.
  - coordinates: The coordinates to reverse geocode.
